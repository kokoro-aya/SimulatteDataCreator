This repo provides a helper tool aimed to make the task of creating new maps for [Simulatte](https://github.com/Ironica/simulatte) less painful by providing an interactive way to complete your map with different info. Your input will be checked before proceeding to the json creation.

I have tried to make the process easy to understand.

Please be aware that the program will throw exceptions and exit if any error or typo is detected. It's therefore preferable to back up your info, to keep trace of it, or write a scratch before feeding the tool.

The tool might have lots of undiscovered bugs.

The `Example.md` provides an example of the output of the tool.
